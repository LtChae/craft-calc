# craft-calc
This is an experiment in using vue.js. It implements a homebrewed crafting system for the Star Wars RPG system.

## Usage
Find the campaign's crafting rules [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xy3y8x5-zzgv091q3XeT37flYmeF1niPavyBDvE3ajI/edit)

Select the enhancements you want for the item, referencing the rules text for each in the source books. The app will calculate the dice pool for the roll as well as the total cost.
